# Plex User Guide

This guide is meant to walk you through what Plex is, what it can do, and a few first steps that are suggested before you stream or request any media.

Please keep in mind that I operate this Plex server as a hobby, and I have multiple friends and family members that use the server. The best way to get support is to reach out to me directly or on the 'Plex Users' group chat.
