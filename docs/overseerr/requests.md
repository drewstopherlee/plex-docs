Overseerr is used primarily as a way for you to request media to be added to Plex. All requests must be approved before they begin downloading, and TV requests may take a little longer as they typically have to be downloaded one season at a time.

:::warning

Please be aware that requests made using Overseerr are visible to **all other users** of Overseerr.

:::

## Making Requests

You can search for new movies and series using the search bar at the top of the screen. You can also browse popular movies/series using the tabs on the left (or bottom) of the screen or in the various sections of the home screen.

:::tip

There are icons in the upper-right corners of some posters. These correspond to the item's status; a green checkmark means it's already available, a green dash means that it's partially available (e.g., some seasons of a show are available, but not all), and a purple clock means that it's been requested, but not downloaded (or released) yet.

:::

Once approved, movie requests should begin downloading automatically, but TV requests still need to be downloaded manually, which can increase the time before they are available.

### Requesting Movies

Once you've found an item you'd like to request, you can either click/tap the Request button on the poster, or click/tap the poster itself for more information on the title (cast, crew, similar titles, runtime, etc.). Once you click/tap Request, a pop-up will display asking you to confirm this request.

:::info

If you request a movie that is not released yet, Overseerr will still process the request, but the movie **may not be immediately available** in Plex. Typically, once a digital copy can be found (around the time it is released online for purchase or streaming), it will download automatically and import into Plex.

:::

While viewing a movie in Overseerr, you may notice a bar that links to a film's collection. For example, if you search "tremors" and view the info page for *Tremors* (1990), there will be a link to "Tremors Collection" near the top of the page. If you click on this link, it will show you the entire franchise of whichever film you searched and allow you to request an entire collection at once.

### Requesting TV Series

Once you've found an item you'd like to request, you can either click/tap the Request button on the poster, or click/tap the poster itself for more information on the title (cast, crew, similar titles, season/episode info, etc.). Once you click/tap Request, a pop-up will display asking you to confirm this request and which seasons you'd like to request.

When you request a *current* series (one that is still airing), the server will **automatically download new episodes as they become available**.

:::info

If you'd like a specific season to be downloaded, i.e. the most recent season, please select only that season. Otherwise, select all seasons. I'm an obsessive completist, so I will eventually get around to downloading the entire series if it's requested, but I'll start with a specific season if that's what you request.

## Checking Requests

You can view active requests by clicking/tapping on Requests in the sidebar. Here you will find some additional information on your active requests and the requests of others. Here's what each of the "Status" items mean:

- **Requested**: The item was requested but it hasn't begun downloading yet.
- **Pending**: The item is still awaiting approval before it can begin downloading.
- **Processing**: The item is currently downloading or is in the queue to be downloaded once other downloads have completed.
- **Available**: The item has been downloaded and added to Plex successfully.
- **Partially Available**: A portion of item requested was downloaded. This is usually because multiple seasons were requested and only some of them are available so far, but it also appears on new series that are currently airing.
