One of the other features of Overseerr is that it allows you to file issues with media items. This allows you to let me know that there is something wrong with a movie or TV series that needs addressing. To file an issue, please follow these steps:

1. Search for the problem item (i.e., the movie or show that's not playing properly).
2. Click the yellow "Report an Issue" button (it may look like a yellow warning sign on some devices).
3. If it is a TV series, please select which season is affected or leave the dropdown set to "All Seasons."
4. Select whether the issue is with the Video, Audio, Subtitle, or Other.
5. Add a description of what is wrong.

#### Examples

- **Issue** > **Audio** > *"The audio for season one episode two is in the wrong language."*
- **Issue** > **Video** > *"This is the wrong movie."*
- **Issue** > **Subtitle** > *"The S02E03 subtitles aren't synced up correctly."*
- **Issue** > **Other** > *"The player closed unexpectedly after I hit play."*
