If you're here, you were probably invited to join my Plex server. The first step is to send me the email address you will use to create your free Plex account. If you've already done this: excellent, continue reading!

Shortly after, you'll receive an email inviting you to join my server. Click the link in the email to accept the invitation and create your account at Plex. Once logged in, you may be asked to "Sync Watch State." I recommend enabling this feature, as it tracks your watch progress and allows you to start watching on one device and pick up on another. It also adds a "Continue Watching" section to your Home screen.

Please don't share the account you create with others. If you know someone who you think would enjoy having access to this server, have them contact me. In most cases I'll be happy to add them with their own account.

Additionally, if you decide to purchase a Plex Pass (unlocks some paid features within your Plex players), the people you add to your "Plex Home" will not have access to my libraries.

Now's the time to connect your playback devices to your new account. Depending on what you're using, you may need to download and install the Plex app your device, or one may have come pre-installed. (This includes the App Store on iOS/tvOS devices, the Google Play Store on Android devices, and other similar stores and libraries on other platforms like Roku.)

:::warning

If you decide to use Plex on a mobile device (Android or iOS), you will be limited to only watching the first 30 seconds of any media file. The two existing workarounds are to "unlock" the app with a one-time in-app purchase or subscribe to Plex Pass. <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/202526943-plex-free-vs-paid/" target="_blank">More information is available here.</a> These limitations do **not** apply to *any* other platform, including the PC app and the Plex web client (see below).

:::

Upon first use for most of these platforms, you will either have to log in with your username and password, or link the device with your account when prompted. To link your account, your Smart TV or streaming device will show you a code made of 4 letters or numbers. Simply visit <a href="https://www.plex.tv/link/" target="_blank">plex.tv/link</a> and enter the code (you may have to sign in first if you're not already). This linking process saves you from having to enter your username and password on your TV which can be frustrating.

Once you've entered the code, your streaming device should sign in automatically after a few seconds.

You can visit the <a href="https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/#plex-app" target="_blank">Plex downloads page</a> to see a list of platforms on which the Plex player is available and be directed on how to install it for your device.

For convenience, Plex provides an online web client you can use to watch content at <a href="https://app.plex.tv/" target="_blank">app.plex.tv</a>. This makes it easy to catch up on your favorite shows while traveling or away from your preferred devices.

:::danger

Using the web client for media playback **should be avoided** when possible as it is inefficient and puts unnecessary strain on the Plex server hardware. There is a Plex app available for <a href="https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/?cat=plex+desktop&plat=windows" target="_blank">Windows</a>, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/?cat=plex+desktop&plat=macos" target="_blank">macOS</a>, and <a href="https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/?cat=plex+desktop&plat=linux" target="_blank">Linux</a>; these are preferred over the web client!
