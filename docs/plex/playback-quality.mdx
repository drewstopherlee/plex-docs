You will have to set your Video Settings on **each** device that you will be using to watch Plex.

:::

Plex playback quality is dynamic and *tries* to adjust to the capabilities of your player and to the available internet bandwidth. However, out of the box, the quality settings in most Plex players are very conservative.

To increase the quality of your playback experience, locate the Settings in your Plex app, and navigate to the Video Settings section. Typically, you should try to set **Local Quality** to *Original* and set **Remote Quality** to *Maximum*. If you then find playback stutters or pauses frequently, reduce the quality setting until you achieve smooth playback. This will ensure that media is played on your device at the highest quality possible and can help reduce strain on the Plex server.

See below for device-specific instructions on how to set up your Video Settings:
