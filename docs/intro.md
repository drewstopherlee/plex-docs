:::info

Please keep in mind that I operate this Plex server as a hobby, and I have multiple friends and family members that use the server. The best way to get support is to reach out to me directly or on the 'Plex Users' group chat on Messenger.

| As an aside, access to my Plex server will <u>*always*</u> be free of charge.<br />However, if you would like to support me, you can use the QR codes/links below: |
